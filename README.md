# MEANr-ng
AngularJS Web App. Part of [MEANr](https://github.com/christurnbull/MEANr) - A MEAN relational stack

DEMO: https://meanr.io

#### Getting Started

1. Make sure you have an API up and running - [MEANr-api](https://github.com/christurnbull/MEANr-api)

2. Fork or Clone this repo ``` git clone https://github.com/christurnbull/MEANr-ng.git ```

3. Install dependencies ``` npm i && bower i```

4. Configure the API address/port and app name in ``` ./app/scripts/app.js ```

5. Run using ``` grunt serve ```

6. Add your source code to ``` ./app/scripts/usr ``` and ``` ./app/views/usr ```

7. Build using ``` grunt build ```

If you change any code in ./app/scripts/core then I suggest renaming the file so you can track and apply updates from the master repository.
